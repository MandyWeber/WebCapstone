Purpose: This is the Music Library tab of the web application.  This includes
a search form that allows the user to search for a song that they're interested
in for their event. It includes the navigation bar and footer with social
media links as well. When the user searches for a song here, the songs will
be pulled from the database and display the results in the search.php file.


Input: User will type a letter, word, or entire song title to see the results
from our music_library database. It will populate all results that match what
they type in whether it's just one character or word, or an entire song title.

Output: On the search.php page the results from the user's input on the
library.html page will display if there are any results. If there are no results,
it will tell the user that.
